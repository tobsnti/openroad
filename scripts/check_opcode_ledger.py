"""Opcode coverage ledger consistency check (EP-04).

The `packets!` macro in `packets/src/lib.rs` is the single source of truth for
which opcodes the client wires. `docs/protocol/opcodes.md` is the human-readable
ledger. This gate fails when the two disagree, so the ledger cannot silently
drift from the code.

It also owns the *count*. A hand-maintained "Wired opcodes: N" line in the
ledger was a serialization point: every net PR had to bump it, so every net PR
collided with every other net PR on that one line (#558) — and because nothing
checked it, main carried a wrong N on 9 of the 51 commits that touched the file.
The count is therefore derived here and printed, never stored; `no_hardcoded_count`
fails the gate if such a line reappears.

Run: `python3 scripts/check_opcode_ledger.py`
