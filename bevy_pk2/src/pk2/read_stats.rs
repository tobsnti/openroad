//! Read instrumentation for [`Archive`](super::archive::Archive) — the number
//! that decides whether a read cache is worth building (#434).
//!
//! Idea: a cache is only a win if the same entry is actually read more than
//! once, and today's read path is already lock-free and positioned
//! (`read_exact_at`), so on a warm OS page cache the saving may be nil. Rather
//! than guess, this counts what a real session does: how many reads happen, how
//! many *distinct* entries they touch, and how many bytes each of those is. The
//! repeat ratio is the cache's best possible hit rate, and the unique byte total
//! is the memory a fully-populated cache would need — both of which #434 wants
//! before any eviction policy is designed.
//!
//! It is **off unless `PK2_READ_STATS` is set**, and the disabled path is a
//! `OnceLock` read plus a branch: no allocation, no lock, no atomics. That
//! matters because #434's rule 3 is that the miss path must stay exactly as fast
//! as it is today, and instrumentation that violated it would measure itself.
