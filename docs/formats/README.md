# Format details

One file per SRO data format: what the bytes mean, as field tables.

## What these are, and where they come from

Each file gives a format's **field layout** — offset, size, type, name — plus
whatever openroad has verified about it from the user's own PK2 corpus. Field
layouts are facts about a file format, and that is deliberately all these
documents carry.

Most files state a layout **derived from openroad's own parser** in
`client/src/assets/` (or `bevy_pk2/` for the archive container itself), verified
against corpus probes. Where our parser and an external source disagree, our
parser wins and the discrepancy is noted — several formats here correct the
commonly circulated description (`.cpd` and `.dof` `Type` are an `i16` pair, not
a `u32`; `.bmt` uses six flag bits, not thirty-two; `.ddj`'s size field is
unreliable).

A few formats have **no openroad parser yet**. Those files say so at the top and
mark their layout unverified — treat them as a lead, not a fact. Pages whose whole
content would have been a restatement of an unlicensed upstream description, with
nothing of our own added, are not kept here at all.

Every file names the external reference it was cross-checked against. Where that
is the [SilkroadDoc wiki](https://github.com/DummkopfOfHachtenduden/SilkroadDoc/wiki),
the citation is a pointer for the reader, not a statement that the text came from
there: that wiki carries no licence, so this project takes **facts and field
layouts** from it and does not copy its prose, pseudocode or ImHex patterns.
The same rule governs every other unlicensed source — see
[`../../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for what each licence class permits
and for the material this repository deliberately does not publish.
