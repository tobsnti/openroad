# Camera (Map/config.ifo) - JMXVCAMR1002 (obsolete)

A single saved editor viewpoint. Upstream marks the format obsolete, and the
v1.188 client never opens the file — see the verdict at the end.

The layout below is **openroad's own**, decoded byte by byte from the only
corpus sample and forced by internal geometric consistency. Upstream reference
(a raw annotated hex dump, superseded by the table below):

## Decoded layout (openroad)

`Map/config.ifo` is the only CAMR in the corpus: 111 bytes, EOF-exact. The raw
dump above is now fully named — every field below is forced by internal
geometric consistency, not guessed:

Proofs: `|at − eye|` = 1353.94094 vs stored `distance` 1353.94092 (Δ 2.6e−5) ·
`eye == at − forward·distance` (max err 2.9e−5) ·
`forward == (cos p·sin y, −sin p, cos p·cos y)` (err ≤ 8.7e−8) ·
`up == (sin p·sin y, cos p, sin p·cos y)` (err ≤ 3.5e−8) · `|up| = |forward| = 1`,
`up·forward = 9.1e−8`, and `right = up × forward` is unit with y = −1.4e−8 ⇒ zero
roll. The basis is **left-handed (D3D)**, matching `D3DXMatrixLookAtLH`.

**Our client hardcoded all three projection constants and all three disagreed**
(`client/src/plugins/camera.rs:104-106`): near 0.500 vs **1.0**, far 200000.0 vs
**5500.0**, fov 1.0 rad (≈57.3°) vs **45°**. See #108.

**What #108 adopted, and what it did not.** `near` and `fov` are taken verbatim.
`far` is **not**: our fog fades from `VISIBLE_RANGE * REGION_SIZE` (3840) to
`(VISIBLE_RANGE + FOG_RANGE) * REGION_SIZE` (5760), and Bevy's linear fog is
`alpha = (d − start) / (end − start)`, so at 5500 terrain is only ~86 % opaque —
a 5500 far plane clips partially transparent geometry out of the outer fog ring
instead of letting it finish fading into the horizon-matched `FOG_COLOR`. The far
plane is now derived from those streaming constants, so retuning them cannot
reintroduce the clip.

Our fog ring width is itself ungrounded (`VISIBLE_RANGE`/`FOG_RANGE` were
promoted from bare literals with no citation), so 5760 and 5500 are two
independently arbitrary numbers that happen to sit 4.7 % apart. Aligning the
streaming radius to 5500 is a defensible follow-up, but it touches six files and
is not a camera-constants change.

Two cautions on this record. `fov` is stored without an aspect ratio, so
"vertical" is inferred from the left-handed D3D basis
(`D3DXMatrixPerspectiveFovLH` takes a y-direction FOV) and from 45° matching
Bevy's own default — **likely, not verified**. And the upstream source marks this
format obsolete ("this file is not used anymore"), with `n = 1` in every build we
have: the confidence covers the *byte layout*, not the claim that this
projection triple is what the shipped gameplay camera used.

## Verdict on loading it: no

The obvious follow-up — *stop hardcoding near/fov, load them* — is answered
**no**:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Does the client open `Map/config.ifo`? | **No** |
| Does it open `Map/camera_path.txt`? | **No** |
| Is there a camera file it *does* open? | **Yes** — `config\cameradata.txt`, read on world entry. |

So a `config.ifo` loader would make our projection depend on a file the original ignores — a saved
editor viewpoint, `n = 1`, of which we would then override the far plane anyway. The three numbers
stay constants in `client/src/plugins/camera.rs`, with their offsets cited at the constant. What changes is
the *claim*: the values are sourced, they are **not** evidence about the shipped camera.

### `Map/camera_path.txt` — unresolved, and not built on

261 bytes of ASCII, three lines, all in region `78, 70` (`Map/70/78.m` exists) at a constant height of
`800.0`, each with `1.570796, 0, 0, 2190.306152`. Read in the `(pitch, yaw, roll, distance)` shape
this family uses elsewhere, `1.570796` = π/2 is straight down and `2190.3` an orbit radius — a
top-down pass, not a flythrough. **But the client never opens the file.** No
consumer, no second sample: unknown, and no loader.

editor viewpoint — which is also why only the projection transfers and the pose
does not (`distance` 1353.94 is far outside our 40–400 clamp; `pitch` 0.9908 rad
*is* inside `[0.1, 1.45]`, so `distance` alone is what disqualifies the pose).
