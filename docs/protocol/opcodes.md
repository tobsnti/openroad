# Protocol opcode coverage ledger

The CI-checkable scoreboard of protocol coverage. It lists every opcode the
client currently wires through the `packets!` macro in
[`packets/src/lib.rs`](../../packets/src/lib.rs) — the single source of truth for
opcode ↔ type ↔ event wiring. `scripts/check_opcode_ledger.py` fails CI if this
table and the macro disagree, so coverage stays honest.

- **Wired opcode count:** not written down here on purpose — it is derived.
  `python3 scripts/check_opcode_ledger.py` prints it (`OK (N opcodes match)`), and
  the gate rejects a hand-maintained number reappearing in this prose (#558).
- **Original client's opcode surface:** the v1.188 client dispatches roughly 320
  server→client handlers and 169 client→server builders (10 opcodes appear in both
  directions). Use 320 as the S→C denominator when quoting coverage: it counts
  server→client handlers only, so C→S requests never count against it.
- **Status legend:** `wired` = typed and fanned out; `experimental` = layout not
  yet capture-verified (marked EXPERIMENTAL in-code).
- **Counter-list:** some ids must **never** become packet types — the original's
  internal pseudo-ids, and real opcodes dispatched outside the three handler
  tables. An absence from this ledger is therefore not automatically a gap.

> Direction is inferred from the opcode range/naming convention
> (`0x2xxx`/`0x6xxx`/`0x7xxx` client→server; `0xAxxx`/`0xBxxx`/`0x3xxx`
> server→client) and cross-checked against the macro's own section comments.

## Handshake & global

| Opcode | Name | Direction | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x2001` | ModuleIdentification | both | wired | first packet on every connection; `u16`-length-prefixed module name. C→S `SR_Client` + a trailing zero (static read of the original client); S→C the peer's own name, matched against `GatewayServer`/`AgentServer`/`DownloadServer` by `ModuleIdentification::peer_kind()`. The trailing byte is optional inbound — no S→C capture exists, it is read during connection setup before the dumping receive loop |
| `0x2002` | KeepAlive | C→S | wired | 5s ping, empty body |
| `0x2005` | GlobalStateUpdate | S→C | wired |  |
| `0x6005` | GlobalStateRequest | C→S | wired | typed but not sent yet |
| `0x2113` | XTrapIdentification | both | wired | anti-cheat challenge/response, 1026 bytes both ways (`u8 kind`, `u8 sub`, `u8[0x400]`); the blob stays opaque, the body is kept whole, and nothing sends a reply |

## Login & gateway

| Opcode | Name | Direction | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x6102` | LoginRequest | C→S | wired |  |
| `0xA102` | LoginResponse | S→C | wired |  |

| `0xA323` | LoginCaptchaConfirmResponse | S→C | wired |  |
| `0x2322` | LoginCaptchaChallenge | S→C | wired |  |
| `0x6100` | PatchRequest | C→S | wired | the original launcher's version check (locale byte, `u16`-prefixed module name, build `u32`), as the v1.208 client sends it. OpenRoad's client does not send it — it does an `SV.T` preflight |
| `0xA100` | PatchResponse | S→C | wired | patch verdict; `result == 1` is a single byte, `result == 2` carries a `PatchErrorCode` (+ the download triple on code `2`). The code-`2` file list is deliberately unmodelled — we never send it |
| `0x6104` | NoticeRequest | C→S | wired | launcher news request, one content-id byte (`0x16` on the v1.208 client); sent a few ms after `0x6100` |
| `0xA104` | NoticeResponse | S→C | wired | **only `noticeCount` is modelled**: the per-notice entries need a counted list of structs the derive cannot express, and the only answer we ever send is the empty one. The launcher blocks on this packet — with a dead notice service it never offers its Start button |
| `0x6101` | ShardListRequest | C→S | wired |  |
| `0xA101` | ShardListResponse | S→C | wired |  |
| `0x6106` | ShardListPingRequest | C→S | wired |  |

## Entity spawn / despawn

| Opcode | Name | Direction | Status | Notes |

## Misc server pushes (captured)

Small S→C pushes decoded from a live vSRO 1.188 world-join capture
(`docs/net-captured-opcodes.md`, PR #179). Typed so the fan-out exists;
client-side handling lands per-epic. `0x3153`/`0x3809` bodies are
capture-verified; `0x3305`/`0x3077` were captured empty, so their list-entry
shapes are unverified (see the struct docs in `agent/ingame.rs`).

| Opcode | Name | Direction | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x3153` | SilkUpdate | S→C | experimental | account silks `{own, gift, point}` (u32×3); capture-verified; feeds cash-shop epic |
| `0x3809` | WeatherUpdate | S→C | experimental | `{weather_type, intensity}` (u8×2); EP-27 (environment/weather) |
| `0x3305` | FriendListInfo | S→C | experimental | friend roster; captured empty; EP-32 / #154 (social) |
| `0x7302` | FriendAddRequest | C→S | wired | add a character to the friend roster: `u16` length + name, and nothing behind it |

| `0x3077` | CharacterFinished | S→C | experimental | join-time cooldown replay (item + skill lists); captured empty; EP-07 |

## Invites & petitions

| Opcode | Name | Direction | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x3080` | GameInvite | S→C **and** C→S | wired | dual-mapped: the petition popup one way, accept/decline the other. **Two petition arms carry tails openroad drops** (, `NetProcessInInterface.cpp`): petition **9** (academy / training-camp join) ends with a `u16`-length **ASCII name** (`:366`, rendered into `UIIT_STT_TC_JOIN_REQUEST`), and petition **7** (enter-instance) carries **23+ bytes** parsed by (`u32, u8, u32, u8, u8, u32, u32, u16 count, count × u32`). Petitions 1–6 and 8 are byte-exact as modelled |
| `0x7062` | PartyInviteRequest | C→S | wired | funnel: server raises a 0x3080 petition on the target |
| `0x7081` | ExchangeInviteRequest | C→S | wired | funnel |
| `0x70F3` | GuildInviteRequest | C→S | wired | funnel |
| `0x7472` | AcademyInviteRequest | C→S | wired | funnel |
| `0x7477` | AcademyNoticeEditRequest | C→S | wired | academy notice edit, `strS strS` |
| `0x747D` | AcademyMatchListRequest | C→S | wired | matching-board page request, one byte |
| `0xB47D` | AcademyMatchListResponse | S→C | experimental | arms typed; the record block stays raw until a capture names it |
| `0xB081` | ExchangeInviteResponse | S→C | wired | inviter-side ack `{success, uid}` |

Not wired: `0xB060` party-ack — **but the premise for leaving it unwired is false.** The original
**does** register a handler, whose own debug string names it
`"OnCreatePartyAck[%d]"`; it is the ack for `0x7060 PartyCreationRequest`, which openroad already
sends. Body: `u8 result`; on `result == 1` a `u32` party value → `*(uint*)+0x18)`
(**5 bytes**); on `result == 2` a `u16` error code → `, category 2 = party
(**3 bytes**). [V] — and this settles the standing `0xB060`-vs-`0xB062` conflict: **0xB060 = create
ack, 0xB062 = invite ack. Different acks, not aliases.** `[U]`: whether the u32 is a party number or
a member count (the client only stores it, and `0xB067` writes the same field).
`0x70B3` is **not** a 0x3080 arm — it pairs with `0xB0B3` stall-talk-response —
and party-match `0x706D`/`0x306E` has its own richer popup.

## GM commands

| Opcode | Name | Direction | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x7010` | GmCommand | C→S | wired | `{u16 sub_id, …typed args}`; sub-ids from the original's own command registry — `0x06` LoadMonster, `0x07` MakeItem, `0x0C` Zoe, `0x0E`/`0x0F` the toggles. **MakeItem was wrongly `0x06` (= LoadMonster) until 2026-08-18.** Note `/zoe` and `/zoe2` share `0x0C`: Zoe2 is a client-side batching wrapper, not a separate sub-command.  |
| `0xB010` | GmResponse | S→C | wired | `{u8 result, u16 gm_command_id, …}` — the u16 echoes the request's sub-command on **both** the ok and fail arms, which is what makes it a probe.  |

## Guild (wire only — see EP-15)

Spec-derived from the original client's parser/builder; **no `packet_dump/`

| `0x34B4` | GuildDataEnd | S→C | experimental | marker |
| `0x30FF` | GuildPlayerLog | S→C | wired | **the original does have a parser** — : `u32 gid`, `u32 guild_id`, `u16+N guild name`, then **only if the name length ≠ 0** (`:80`) `u16+M grant name`, `u32 crest rev`, `u32 union id`, `u32 union crest rev`, `u8 fortress position` (a **bit-valued** enum: 1 commander, 2 sub-commander, 4 battle-manager, 8 product-manager, 0x10 trainer-manager, 0x20 engineer) and `u8 relation flag`. It is a guild-tag update, not an activity log. [V] |

| `0xB0F0` | GuildCreatedData | S→C | experimental | success + the same record inline |
| `0x70F9` | GuildNoticeEditRequest | C→S | experimental | title + message |

### Guild lifecycle & membership

The command acks share **one body form** — `{result:u8}` on success, plus a
`u16` error code on refusal — because their handlers sit in one VA cluster
 and each reads the same two fields; the matching server
writers emit the single byte `01`. Layouts, handler VAs and the opcodes that stay
unwired (with the reason) are in
. Spec-derived from the
original's reader *and* writer; no `packet_dump/` sample exists, so all are
`experimental`.

| Opcode | Name | Direction | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x3100` | EntityGuildRemove | S→C | experimental | bare `u32` entity id; one per member while disbanding |
| `0xB0F1` | GuildDisbandAck | S→C | experimental | shared ack form; disband vs leave is [S], see the doc |
| `0xB0F2` | GuildLeaveAck | S→C | experimental | shared ack form |

| `0x7104` | GuildPermissionUpdateRequest | C→S | experimental | one `u8`; inlined ctor |

### Guild union / alliance

Requests and acks share the same handler
cluster as the guild ack form above; details in
. `0x3102` (union roster push) stays
unwired — its record was never decoded. No `packet_dump/` sample exists.

| `0xB0FD` | UnionExpelAck | S→C | experimental | shared guild ack form |

### Guild leadership (transfer, elections, GP history)

Three of the four acks are the shared guild ack form; `0xB106` and `0xB501` are
the only guild bodies with a repeating record. `0xB501`'s row leads with a 32-bit
`time_t` — `[V]`, because the original passes it to the CRT's `_localtime32_s`.
Every request field is `[U]`: the builders give widths, nothing names them.

### Guild war & siege authority

`0x30EF` keys a **guild-id** set, not an entity flag — one packet changes the
relation to every member of that guild. `0xB114`'s `u32` is the compensation
amount, named by the server writer itself (`0x4C45` = "no compensation" appears
on both sides). Details: . `0x3109`
`GuildWarInfo` and `0x7113` stay unwired, with reasons in that doc.

| Opcode | Name | Direction | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Fortress war (wire only — no consumer yet, see #156)

`0x385F` is a `u8` sub-command family (0x35 arms, handler the client's handler). The
two arms our own `packet_dump/0x385f.log` contains are decoded; the other 52 keep
their bytes, because only the first 150 instructions of the dispatcher were
disassembled. Five record fields have a verified width and no naming site, so
they are carried as `unk_*` until a **wartime** capture — the peacetime capture
has them all zero. Arithmetic: `1 + 1 + count x 28 + 1 + 4 = 91`, the exact
captured body length. Details:
.

| Opcode | Name | Direction | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x385F` | SiegeUpdate | S→C | experimental | sub 0 fortress list (capture-verified), sub 0x34 application-period end, everything else raw |

## Party (wire only — no consumer yet, see EP-14 #96)

Spec-derived from the original client's parser/builder cross-checked against
go-sro; **no `packet_dump/` sample exists for any of them**, so all are
`experimental`. Byte layouts, per-field [V]/[S]/[U] tags and the resolving
capture for each unknown: ; the
family's remainder ledger (what the 171-entry seed never saw, and why `0xB067`
is still unwired) is .

| opcode | type | dir | status | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x3065` | PartyData | S→C | wired | full roster; the header is `u8 presence mask` + `u32 number` + *conditional* `u32 master_jid`/`u8 setup` — resolved against a capture: go-sro's split is right and xBot's is wrong ( |
| `0x3864` | PartyUpdate | S→C | experimental | delta; type 9 (new master) body unknown |
| `0x306E` | PartyMatchJoinResponse | C→S | experimental | C→S despite the 0x3xxx range |
| `0x7060` | PartyCreationRequest | C→S | experimental | `unique_id` invitee-vs-self is [U] |
| `0x7061` | PartyLeave | C→S | experimental | empty body |
| `0x7063` | PartyKickRequest | C→S | experimental |  |
| `0x7069` | PartyMatchCreationRequest | C→S | experimental | second u32 always 0, purpose [U] |
| `0x706A` | PartyMatchEditedRequest | C→S | experimental | **SPEC only** — no original-client builder |
| `0x706B` | PartyMatchDeleteRequest | C→S | experimental |  |
| `0x706C` | PartyMatchListRequest | C→S | experimental | number shared with CLIENT_PET_DESTROY |
| `0x706D` | PartyMatchJoinNotify | S→C | experimental | bidirectional opcode; only the S→C notify is registered |
| `0xB069` | PartyMatchCreationResponse | S→C | experimental | **SPEC only** — no original-client parser |
| `0xB06A` | PartyMatchEditedResponse | S→C | experimental | **SPEC only** — no original-client parser |
| `0xB06B` | PartyMatchDeleteResponse | S→C | experimental | number present only on success |
| `0xB06C` | PartyMatchListResponse | S→C | experimental | `race_type` semantics [U] |
| `0x3068` | PartyDistribution | S→C | experimental | item handed to a member; the tail's width is the ITEM's class, read behind a resolver |
| `0xB060` | PartyCreateResponse | S→C | experimental | the **create** ack (not the invite ack — attribution corrected); JID on success, `u16` code on failure |
| `0xB062` | PartyInviteResponse | S→C | experimental | the invite ack; empty on success, the invitation itself is `0x3080` |
| `0xB06D` | PartyMatchJoinAck | S→C | experimental | branches on `result == 1`, not `== 2` — both tails are `u16` |

## Quest marks (wire only — the quest system itself is #37)

The only two opcodes of the quest family with evidence on this machine, and the
only **capture-verified** rows in this section of the ledger. Everything else the
family has is listed unwired, with its handler VA and its reason, in
 — including the correction that `0x30D0`,
`0x30D2`, `0x30D3` and `0x30DF` are not quest opcodes at all.

| opcode | type | dir | status | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x30D6` | QuestMarkAdd | S→C | wired | 24 bytes; `mark_id` is a server pool handle, the four trailing `u32`s are [U] |
| `0x30D7` | QuestMarkRemove | S→C | wired | whole body is a `mark_id` an earlier `0x30D6` introduced — the capture proves the pairing |

## Player stall / private shop (wire only — no consumer yet, see EP-16 / Trading #36)

Spec-derived; **no `packet_dump/` sample exists for any of them**, so all are
`experimental`. Byte layouts, per-field [V]/[S]/[U] tags and the resolving capture
for each unknown: .

The stall listing streams as a **0xFF-sentinel-terminated** row list whose rows
embed the shared item body, so `0x30B7` and `0xB0BA` keep their rows raw behind
resolver-taking accessors — no derive list mode can express either half.

| opcode | type | dir | status | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x70B1` | StallCreateRequest | C→S | experimental | title only; the original's 63-char cap is UI policy, not wire framing |
| `0x70B2` | StallDestroyRequest | C→S | experimental | empty body |
| `0x70B4` | StallBuyRequest | C→S | experimental | one slot byte |
| `0x70B5` | StallLeaveRequest | C→S | experimental | empty body |
| `0x70BA` | StallUpdateRequest | C→S | experimental | derived enum over the update type; trailing `unknown0` on the item types and State only |
| `0xB0B1` | StallCreateResponse | S→C | experimental | `result == 2` carries a u16 error code |
| `0xB0B2` | StallDestroyResponse | S→C | experimental | same result/error shape |
| `0xB0B4` | StallBuyResponse | S→C | experimental | slot on success, u16 error otherwise (branches on `!= 1`) |
| `0xB0B5` | StallLeaveResponse | S→C | experimental | same result/error shape; the leading byte is [S] (go-sro emits, xBot ignores) |
| `0xB0BA` | StallUpdateResponse | S→C | experimental | per-type body; add/remove carry the whole listing as raw rows |
| `0x30B7` | StallEntityAction | S→C | experimental | enter/exit carry a viewer id; buy carries the buyer and the remaining listing |
| `0x30B8` | EntityStallCreate | S→C | experimental | uid + title + decoration id |
| `0x30B9` | EntityStallDestroy | S→C | experimental | trailing u16 is [S] (go-sro emits, xBot comments it out) |
| `0x30BB` | EntityStallTitleUpdate | S→C | experimental | title edits arrive here, not on 0xB0BA |
| `0xB0B3` | StallTalkResponse | S→C | experimental | the viewer's snapshot on entering a stall: header, the listing as raw rows, then the viewer id list (#759) |

Not wired, with the reason written down rather than a guessed layout (#759,
`net-stall-0x30B7.md` §9): **`0x70B3`** (the C→S half of stall-talk — pairing is
[V], body transcribed nowhere on this machine), and **`0xB0BC` / `0xB0BE`**, which
are not this family at all: their handler VAs sit in the buff neighbourhood next to
`0xB0BD BuffAdd`, not with the stall handlers.

## Mail/memo + consignment (wire only — no consumer yet, see EP-17)

Spec-derived; **no `packet_dump/` sample exists for any of them**, so all are
`experimental`. Byte layouts, per-field [V]/[S]/[U] tags and the resolving capture
for each unknown: .

| opcode | type | dir | status | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x750E` | ConsignmentListRequest | C→S | experimental | empty body |
| `0xB508` | ConsignmentRegisterResponse | S→C | experimental | fixed 30-byte listing rows; `result == 2` carries a u16 error code |
| `0xB509` | ConsignmentUnregisterResponse | S→C | experimental | records are variable-length and itemdata-dependent, so the list stays raw behind a resolver-taking accessor |
| `0x7309` | MailSendRequest | C→S | experimental | verified head (title + message) only; everything after it is [U] and kept as a raw tail |
| `0x730B` | MailListRequest | C→S | wired | the mailbox asks for its list; empty body |

Deliberately **not** wired — all three bodies are entirely unverified, so a layout
would have to be invented: `0xB309 SERVER_MAIL_SEND_RESPONSE` (declared in the
original's opcode enum but it has no parser and no dispatch case at all),
`0x7508 CLIENT_CONSIGNMENT_REGISTER_REQUEST` and `0x7509
CLIENT_CONSIGNMENT_UNREGISTER_REQUEST` (enum-only, no builder). They need
`packet_dump/0xb309.log`, `0x7508.log` and `0x7509.log` respectively.

## Pet / COS (consumed by `client/src/plugins/cos/`, EP-19 #101)

Layouts come from the original client's own handlers and builders, cross-checked
against the vSRO server's writers where one exists:
Those supersede the older third-party-derived notes, which are wrong in
five places.

Captures exist for the vehicle half only (`packet_dump/{0x30c8,0x30c9,0xb0cb}.log`,
`c2s/{0x70c5,0x70cb}.log`, 2026-08-16). **No attack-pet or pick-pet packet has ever
been captured**, so the growth block, the pick-pet settings word and `0xB0C5` are
implemented from the binaries alone — CAPTURE_LIST F5/F8/F9.

| opcode | type | dir | status | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x30C8` | PetData | S→C | experimental | header only; the tail layout is chosen by the model's `tid4`, which is not in the body — read through `PetData::body` |
| `0x30C9` | PetUpdate | S→C | experimental | all seven arms modelled (`PetUpdatePayload`). Arm 3 is `{i64 exp_delta, u32 source_uid}` — **signed**, a death subtracts. Arm 2's item records need the itemdata resolver, so they are read through `PetUpdate::bag_items` |
| `0x30E7` | StuckDistanceWarning | S→C | experimental | one reason byte; not COS-only (1 = job trade cart, 2 = quest monster). The distances the original prints are its own literals |
| `0xB0C5` | PetActionResponse | S→C | experimental | 0x70C5 ack. The error code sits **between** the action echo and the uid, so the uid's offset moves with `result`; `item_gid` only on action 8 |
| `0xB0C6` | PetTerminateResponse | S→C | experimental | success body empty; the guard is `result != 1`, not `== 2` |
| `0xB0CB` | PetPlayerMounted | S→C | experimental | mount/dismount ack. `riding_unique_id` is **unconditional** — a dismount is 10 bytes, and gating it on `is_mounting` (an xBot error) consumed 6 |
| `0xB116` | PetUnsummonResponse | S→C | experimental | success body empty; COS error category `0x0C` |
| `0xB117` | PetRenameResponse | S→C | experimental | success body empty — the new name arrives as `0x30C9` arm 5, so nothing is applied optimistically |
| `0xB420` | PetSettingsChangeResponse | S→C | experimental | `settings` is present on **both** `settings_type` arms (1 = gold pet, 2 = cash pet), not just type 1 |
| `0x70C5` | PetActionRequest | C→S | experimental | three builder shapes: `Movement`, `Turn` (`u16` heading), and the 9-byte `Attack`/`ItemPickUp`. Actions 2 and 8 are [V] from the server's own writer; `Follow` (9) is **[S]** from Hyperbot — 0xB0C5 echoes the action byte, which is what will settle it. Unknown codes keep a raw tail |
| `0x70C6` | PetTerminateRequest | C→S | experimental | `{u32}`. Distinct from unsummon |
| `0x70CB` | PetMountRequest | C→S | experimental | `{u8 mount_state, u32 cos_unique_id}` — **byte first**. Previously wired as a `[U]` 4-byte guess, which was wrong in both width and order; `packet_dump/c2s/0x70cb.log` recorded those probes |
| `0x7116` | PetUnsummonRequest | C→S | experimental | `{u32}` |
| `0x7117` | PetRenameRequest | C→S | experimental | `{u32, string}` (`IFCOSInfo.cpp`) |
| `0x7420` | PetSettingsChangeRequest | C→S | experimental | shape from the vSRO server's own reader (`u32, u8, u32`), not from a client builder |

Deliberately **not** wired: `0x30CA` and `0xB0C7` have [V] layouts but [U]
semantics, so nothing could drive them honestly; `0x70C0`/`0x70C7` likewise.
`0x706C CLIENT_PET_DESTROY` shares its number with `PartyMatchListRequest` above,
and one opcode maps to one type.

## Player exchange / trade (wire only — see EP-17)

Spec-derived from the original client's parser/builder; **no `packet_dump/`
sample exists for any of them**, so all are `experimental`. Byte layouts and the
resolving capture per unknown: .
The own-side staging half is not here — it rides `0x7034`/`0xB034` sub-ops 4/5/13,
still missing from `InventoryOperationRequest`.

| Opcode | Name | Direction | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x3085` | ExchangeStarted | S→C | experimental | window opened; partner uid |
| `0x3086` | ExchangePlayerConfirmed | S→C | experimental | empty body |
| `0x3087` | ExchangeCompleted | S→C | experimental | empty body |
| `0x3088` | ExchangeCanceled | S→C | wired | **fixed 2 bytes, not empty**: `u16 reason` — the original *does* read it and renders it as an exchange-failed message; the server writes exactly one field. A lost field, not a decode failure. [V] |
| `0x3089` | ExchangeGoldUpdate | S→C | wired | the leading byte is a **mode discriminator**, not an unknown: `1` = a staged **item** (`u8 slot` + the shared item block), `2` = staged **gold** (`u64`); other modes read nothing . Decoding a mode-1 body with the current `{u8, u64}` struct yields garbage gold. [V] |
| `0x308C` | ExchangeItemsUpdate | S→C | experimental | partner's staged items; raw tail, resolver-decoded |
| `0x7082` | ExchangeConfirmRequest | C→S | experimental | empty body |
| `0x7083` | ExchangeApproveRequest | C→S | experimental | empty body |
| `0x7084` | ExchangeExitRequest | C→S | experimental | empty body **inferred** — no original builder |
| `0xB082` | ExchangeConfirmResponse | S→C | experimental |  |
| `0xB083` | ExchangeApproveResponse | S→C | experimental |  |
| `0xB084` | ExchangeExitResponse | S→C | experimental |  |

## Not yet wired

Major subsystems with **no** opcodes wired yet. These are the coverage frontier:

- **Guild** chat / war / storage / alliance — EP-15 (the guild record, log, update and notice edit are wired above)
- **Storage** — EP-17 (player exchange is wired above; own-side staging still missing)
- **Quest** — EP-21
- **Alchemy** (elixir/stone fusion) — P4/P5
- **Friends / block list** — the join-time roster push `0x3305` is wired
  (experimental, empty-capture only); the request/manage path is still later
- **Item cooldown replay** — `0x3077` CharacterFinished is wired (experimental,
  empty-capture only); its entry shape needs a capture with active cooldowns.
  (Item use `0x704C`/`0xB04C` itself is now wired — see Inventory & equipment.)
- **Character creation send path** (`0x7007` Create/CheckName/Restore actions)
  — the response enum exists but the requests are not sent yet (EP-10)

Received and deliberately **ignored** by the original, so not wired here either
(kept out of the table above because `scripts/check_opcode_ledger.py` requires
every table row to exist in the `packets!` macro):

- **`0x2110`** — the original's receive loop has an explicit branch that skips the
  whole body without reading a byte, and the opcode is in none of its three
  registration tables. There is no layout to
  wire. Listed in `KNOWN_IGNORED_OPCODES` (`client/src/plugins/net/plugin.rs`) so a
  future capture is logged as known-and-ignored, not as an unhandled opcode, and does
  not attract a speculative layout.
