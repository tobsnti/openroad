//! Player stall / private shop ("grocery stall"): the owner's create/destroy and
//! edit requests, the viewer's enter/buy/leave path, and the entity pushes that
//! show a stall in the world.
//!
//! **Spec-derived.** No sample body is available for any opcode in this family.
//! Byte-level notes, the per-field confidence and the open questions live in
//! `docs/net-stall-0x30B7.md`.
//!
//! Sourcing note: the doc reads the original through xBot, which is **not**
//! available here, so those citations cannot be re-checked. Two sources that are
//! available carried this instead — the go-sro agent server
//! (`sro-refs/go-sro-agent-server/handler/stall/`), which the doc does cite, and
//! `sro-refs/SilkroadDoc-wiki` (`AGENT_STALL_*.md`, `StallAction.md`,
//! `StallUpdateType.md`, `StallErrorCode.md`), which it does not. Several fields
//! here are only assumed in the doc — go-sro emits them while xBot has them
//! commented out; those are wired, because dropping a field the server sends
//! desyncs everything after it. The wiki additionally supplies four bodies the
//! doc leaves unconfirmed; each is noted at its type.
//!
//! All 14 opcodes in scope are wired, plus the `0x70B3`/`0xB0B3` stall-talk
//! pair: the response since #759, and the request, whose body follows what the
//! original's request builder writes rather than a documented source
//! (see [`StallTalkRequest`]).
//!
//! ## Why the item-bearing pushes keep a raw tail
//!
//! Stall inventory streams as a **0xFF-sentinel-terminated** list — the row's
//! leading stall-slot byte doubles as the terminator — and each row embeds the
//! shared item body, whose width depends on the client's itemdata tables. The
//! derive has no sentinel list mode, and `Deserialize` cannot take an
//! `ItemClassResolver`, so `0xB0BA` and `0x30B7` keep their rows raw behind
//! resolver-taking accessors, as `parse_storage_items` and
//! `InventoryOperationResult::pickup_item` already do.
