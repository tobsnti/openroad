//! Party wire opcodes: party data/update (0x3065, 0x3864), the create/leave/kick
//! requests (0x7060/0x7061/0x7063) and the party-match family (0x706x / 0xB06x).
//!
//! **Spec-derived, not capture-verified.** No `packet_dump/` sample exists for
//! any opcode in this family, so every layout here comes from statically reading
//! the original client's parser/builder (xBot `PacketParser.cs`/`PacketBuilder.cs`)
//! cross-checked against go-sro's handlers. Byte-level notes, per-field [V]/[S]/[U]
//! tags and the resolving capture for each unknown live in
//! `docs/net-party-0x3065.md`. Three opcodes (0x706A, 0xB069, 0xB06A) have **no**
//! original-client code at all and are go-sro-shaped only — flagged per struct.
//!
//! # The presence-mask correction
//!
//! The one place that is **not** spec-derived is the record framing, and it is
//! the load-bearing one. `docs/re/net/inbound/party.md` decompiled the original's
//! own handlers — `FUN_00883cc0` (0x3065), `FUN_00886b10` (0x3864),
//! `FUN_00884660` (0x706D) and the shared member reader `FUN_00883620` — and they
//! agree on a shape neither xBot nor go-sro states outright: **both the roster
//! header and every member record begin with a presence bitmask, and only the
//! fields whose bit is set are on the wire.**
//!
//! A record with *all* bits set is byte-for-byte what the older fixed-layout
//! model read, which is exactly why the bug hid: the full record is the common
//! case, so the fixed reading survived every desk check. A partial record —
//! which is the normal shape of a 0x3864 delta — mis-slices from the first
//! absent field onward and desynchronises the rest of the packet.
//!
//! Three consequences worth stating because they contradict older notes:
//!
//! - the "opaque 9 bytes" of [`PartyData`] are resolved, and with them the
//!   **party leader** (`master_join_id`), which the client-side roster used to
//!   declare UNKNOWN;
//! - `unk_byte07` (a byte xBot reads in the 0x3864 flavour of the record) **does
//!   not exist** — the binary has no such read, so the two record flavours
//!   collapse into the single [`PartyMemberCore`];
//! - [`PartyMemberUpdate`]'s `kind` is a **bitmask**, not an enum, so combined
//!   masks like `0x24` (level *and* hp/mp) are ordinary traffic.
//!
//! The invite path (0x7062 / 0xB060 / 0x3080) is deliberately not here; see
//! `docs/net-invite-0x3080.md`.
//!
//! ⚠️ Free-text caveat: the derive decodes `String` with `from_utf8`, which
//! **fails the whole packet** on an invalid byte, whereas the original reads
//! cp1252 and never fails. `title`, `name` and `guild_name` here are all
//! user-authored, so a non-UTF-8 byte drops the event. That is a pre-existing
//! tree-wide property of the derived string path (the hand-written paths use a
//! lossy reader for exactly this reason — see `character_data::read_string`),
//! not something this module introduces; it is called out because party titles
//! are a likelier place to meet it than most.

// `0xB060` (`AGENT_PARTY_CREATE`) and `0x7062` with `0xB062`
// (`AGENT_PARTY_INVITE`), and go-sro's table agrees. The invite ack that doc
