//! Pet / COS wire opcodes: the summon blob (0x30C8), its delta (0x30C9), the
//! command/mount/settings acks (0xB0C5 / 0xB0C6 / 0xB0CB / 0xB116 / 0xB117 /
//! 0xB420) and the client commands that drive them (0x70C5 action, 0x70C6
//! terminate, 0x70CB mount, 0x7116 unsummon, 0x7117 rename, 0x7420 settings).
//!
//! **Binary-derived.** Every layout here is read off the original 1.188 client's
//! own parser/builder functions and, where one exists, cross-checked against the
//! vSRO server's writer — `docs/re/net/inbound/pet-cos.md` and
//! `docs/re/net/outbound/pet-cos.md` carry the per-field evidence, the handler
//! and builder VAs, and the [V]/[S]/[U] tags. Those two supersede the older
//! xBot-derived `docs/net-pet-0x30C8.md`, which is wrong in four places this
//! module used to inherit (0x30C9's missing arms, 0xB0CB's conditional riding
//! uid, 0xB420's conditional settings word, 0x70CB's body).
//!
//! Captures exist for part of the family and are the tie-breaker where they
//! reach: `packet_dump/{0x30c8,0x30c9,0xb0cb}.log` and
//! `packet_dump/c2s/{0x70c5,0x70cb}.log`. **Attack-pet samples landed
//! 2026-08-18/19** (a Grey Wolf, ref 6106) and they settle the growth block —
//! see [`CosGrowth`], whose three fields were `[U]` by name until then. The
//! pick-pet settings word and 0xB0C5 are still binary-only, pending
//! CAPTURE_LIST group F.
//!
//! `0x706C CLIENT_PET_DESTROY` is deliberately **not** wired: it shares its
//! number with `PartyMatchListRequest` (`party.rs`) and one opcode maps to one
//! type.
//!
//! ## Why 0x30C8 keeps a raw tail
//!
//! The COS kind that selects the body's layout is **not a byte in the body** —
//! the original derives it from the ref object's refdata `tid` word and then
//! gates the body on it (`FUN_009a1900`, see [`CosKind`]). `Deserialize` takes
//! no context, so the packet stops after the two header fields and the body is
//! read through [`PetData::body`] once the caller has resolved the kind — the
//! same split that keeps `CharacterDataBody` raw (`ingame.rs:9-16`) and
//! `InventoryOperationResult::pickup_item` resolver-driven (`inventory.rs:412`).
//! A wrong guess then costs a `None`, not a failed packet.
//!
//! 0x30C8's body used to be three fixed xBot-derived tail structs picked by a
//! `PET_TYPE_*` byte. The recovered parser (#545) shows a single grammar whose
//! optional blocks are gated per kind, so the tails could not express it: a
//! transport is not a shorter pet, it is the same record with four gates shut.
//!
//! ⚠️ Free-text caveat: the derive decodes `String` with `from_utf8`, so a
//! cp1252/CP949 byte in a COS name makes [`PetData::body`] return `None`. That
//! is the tree-wide derived-string property `party.rs:15-22` documents; here it
//! is contained to one accessor instead of dropping the packet, because the
//! header is parsed separately.
