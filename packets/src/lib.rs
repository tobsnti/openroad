// COUNTING RULE for this table — four planning docs once quoted four different
// "wired opcodes" numbers (85 / 67 / 171 / 176). They were not four measures: the
// two counting methods in use (this line-anchored grep and the macro-block parser
// in scripts/check_opcode_ledger.py) return the same set, so those were four
// undated snapshots of ONE number. State the date and the method, or the next
// reader re-derives the same confusion. One entry below = one wired opcode:
//
//   grep -cE '^\s*0x[0-9A-Fa-f]{4} => ' packets/src/lib.rs
//
// It counts BOTH directions. A direction split needs the ledger's Direction
// column (`docs/protocol/opcodes.md`), not this file: three opcodes (0x2001,
// 0x2113, 0x3080) carry traffic both ways, so the two directions add up to more
// than the total. Do not write the total into prose anywhere: since #638 the
// ledger deliberately carries no hand-maintained count and the gate rejects one
// coming back — `python3 scripts/check_opcode_ledger.py` prints it instead, and
// that command is the authority a doc should cite.
