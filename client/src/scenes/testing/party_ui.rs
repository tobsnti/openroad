//! Idea: an offline preview of every party surface at once — the roster page,
//! the quick-party board, the mode modal and the matching board with its
//! dialogs — driven by a mock roster and a mock match page. Run with
//! `SCENE=ui_testing`.
//!
//! This exists because the party feature is the one surface that cannot be
//! inspected alone: it needs a *second player*, and half of it only appears
//! once a server has pushed a roster. Seeding the same resources the network
//! layer writes gives the whole thing a look without a login, and it exercises
//! the presence-mask fold rather than sidestepping it — every mock record
//! carries a real mask, and one of them is deliberately partial so the "unknown
//! field draws empty" path is on screen rather than only in a test.
//!
//! The windows' own Update systems already run in `SceneState::UiTesting`, so
//! this only spawns them, seeds the state and opens them.
