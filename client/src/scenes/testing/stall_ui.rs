//! Idea: an offline preview of the player stall window. Run with
//! `SCENE=ui_testing`. The window's own Update systems already run in
//! `SceneState::UiTesting`, so this only opens it and fills the model with
//! placeholder rows — there is no wire in #779, and the two strings it seeds
//! are the original's own defaults (`UIIT_STT_STALL_DEFAULT_TITLE` /
//! `_OWNERMSG`, with their `[%s]` owner slot filled in) rather than invented
//! copy.
