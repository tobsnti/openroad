//! Click-to-talk: walk into range of a clicked NPC, then open its dialog.
//!
//! Idea: per vanilla, a single click on an NPC both selects it and starts the
//! talk approach. The walk is purely client-side, modeled on the combat
//! gap-close (`combat::close_attack_gap`) but with its own [`PendingTalk`]
//! state so the combat cancel rules never fight it: the player is steered via
//! `PlayerCommands::move_to` until within [`TALK_GAP_STOP`] of the NPC, then
//! the close→select→talk packet sequence goes out (0x704B/0x7045/0x7046,
//! capture-informed) and a [`TalkStarted`] message hands over to the dialog
//! HUD (which opens immediately; the 0xB046 ack is logging-only). A manual
//! ground click, selecting something else, or Esc cancels the approach.
