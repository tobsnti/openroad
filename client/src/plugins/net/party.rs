//! Client-side party roster: 0x3065's full list plus 0x3864's deltas, folded
//! into one resource.
//!
//! Idea: the whole party wire family is already parsed in
//! `packets::agent::party`, but nothing client-side kept it, so every consumer
//! (the world-map markers, the minimap signs, the party window) would have to
//! fold the full-roster packet and its five delta types itself. This module is
//! the single place that does it, and it keeps the wire shapes verbatim: a
//! member is stored as the wire's own [`PartyMemberCore`], and `hp_mp` stays the
//! raw byte the server sent ([`PartyHpMp`] packs both bars into nibbles).
//! Turning that byte into percentages is the view's job — the roster gauges are
//! a crop, not a stretch, so quantisation belongs where it is drawn, not here.
//!
//! # Records are partial, so the fold MERGES
//!
//! Every party record on the wire begins with a presence bitmask and carries
//! only the fields whose bit is set (see `packets::agent::party`'s module note).
//! A full roster push names everything; a 0x3864 delta typically names one
//! field. So a stored member is the **accumulation** of every record seen for
//! that id, not the last one: overwriting the record with a two-byte hp/mp delta
//! would blank the member's name, level, guild and position. `presence` is
//! OR-ed as it goes, so it always says what we actually know about a member.
//!
//! The leader is now modelled — `PartyData`'s header bit 0 carries
//! `master_join_id`, which the original compares against the local player's own
//! JID. That used to be an UNKNOWN here because the header was nine opaque
//! bytes; the binary resolved it.
//!
//! The second half of the file is the outbound side: the four verbs the player
//! can actually trigger (invite / create / leave / kick) and the two acks that
//! answer them. See the section comment there for why one message covers both
//! invite opcodes.
