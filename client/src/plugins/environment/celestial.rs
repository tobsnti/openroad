// Idea: the sun and moon are unlit, additively blended quads riding the day-cycle circle
// (the same `(t - 0.25) * TAU` angle that drives the directional light, but *unclamped* —
// the billboard genuinely sets and rises while the light's pitch stays floored above the
// horizon, see `apply_environment`). They sit between the gradient sky cuboid and the
// cloud layers, re-centered on the active camera every frame like the rest of the skybox.
// Textures come from the user's own Map.pk2 (the exact archive layout varies by client
// version), so a missing/failed texture just keeps the billboard hidden with a one-shot
// warning instead of failing the load screen — which is also why these are lazy
// `asset_server.load`s and not part of the `MapsAssets` collection. Additive blending
// makes the textures' black background transparent for free. The sun quad is tinted by
// the profile's SunColor graph in `apply_environment`.
