//! One-shot screenshot capture: `SCREENSHOT=<path>` renders, grabs a frame, writes
//! a PNG and exits.
//!
//! Idea (#564): UI work on this project is judged against the original client's
//! own art, but an autonomous session cannot use `screencapture` — it needs a
//! composited, unlocked desktop and returns an all-black frame otherwise. So the
//! capture is taken inside our own render graph instead of asking the OS.
//!
//! The first implementation captured the *swapchain* (`Screenshot::primary_window`)
//! on the theory that a readback of the surface texture bypasses the compositor.
//! Measured on macOS with the display locked (#709) it does not: every pixel came
//! back `Rgb([0,0,0])`, including for a pure-UI control scene that cannot
//! legitimately be black. The swapchain is the one render target whose contents
//! depend on the window server, so a window that is never composited yields a
//! cleared surface.
//!
//! Therefore the capture frame is rendered **offscreen**: we allocate an image the
//! size of the window's framebuffer, point every window-targeted camera at it for
//! the capture frame, and read *that* back (`Screenshot::image`). A camera drawing
//! into a GPU image never touches the window server, so the result is identical on
//! a locked display, over SSH, or on a visible desktop — and it is deterministic,
//! which is what a scripted acceptance test needs. Cameras that already render to
//! their own images (HUD portrait / paper-doll RTTs) are left alone.
//!
//! The capture is asynchronous — the readback lands one or more frames after the
//! request — so this is a small state machine rather than a single system: wait for
//! the scene to settle, retarget the cameras, give the render world a couple of
//! frames to allocate the image and draw into it, spawn one [`Screenshot`], and
//! exit from the observer that receives the image. A watchdog covers the case where
//! the image never arrives, so a scripted run fails instead of hanging forever.
//!
//! The cameras are never pointed back at the window: the process exits as soon as
//! the PNG is written (or the watchdog fires), so restoring them would only add a
//! state to the machine that nothing can observe.
//!
//! Exit codes are the contract for that script:
//!
//! | code | meaning |
//! |------|---------|
//! | 0    | PNG written |
//! | 3    | frame captured but could not be encoded/written |
//! | 4    | capture never came back within the watchdog |
//! | 101  | the client panicked (rust's default) — i.e. *not* a screenshot failure |
//!
//! **A screenshot of this client is SRO asset data**: it is the user's own PK2
//! art, rendered. It must never be committed. Bare filenames are therefore
//! resolved under the gitignored [`SCREENSHOT_DIR`], the same treatment
//! `packet_dump/` gets for runtime output.
