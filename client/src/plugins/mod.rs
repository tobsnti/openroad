    /// stubs whose comment proposed "bevy-modding or `include!`", plus a
    /// `sro_v188` version-plugin that only logged its own name at `Startup`.

    /// look like a live one. #56-C removed them; this pins the decision so a
    /// future "plugin loader" has to argue with `CLAUDE.md` first.
    ///
    /// Note what this does NOT forbid: `dynamic_resource_loader` (SRO resource
    /// mirroring, used by 16 modules) and the `bevy_asset_loader` asset
    /// loaders are unrelated to code loading — which is why the predicate is
    /// the two removed type names, not the word "loader".
    /// #56-C, the last part: **exactly one UI module.** `plugins::ui` used to
    /// sit next to `plugins::ui_v2` and read like a v1 of it. Measured, it was
    /// four unrelated things — a hand-rolled text input and a button system
    /// (dead, removed), the 2d UI camera and window settings (live), and the
    /// shared context-menu widget (live). The dead halves went, and the two
    /// live halves moved to the modules that own their domain
    /// (`plugins::camera`, `plugins::options_video`, `plugins::hud`), so the
    /// duality is gone rather than migrated.
    ///
    /// The predicate is the module declaration, and `ui_v2` deliberately stays.
