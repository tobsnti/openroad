//! How a changed setting reaches its consumer at runtime (#647).
//!
//! # The mechanism
//!
//! There is exactly one, and it is Bevy's own change detection — not a bespoke
//! event bus:
//!
//! 1. Settings live in **two** resources. [`ClientConfig`] is the author-facing
//!    `config.yaml` (graphics knobs, colours, window); [`GameOptions`] is the
//!    player-facing, persisted option set the options window edits.
//! 2. Anything *derived* from them (a resolved colour palette, a `Bloom`
//!    component, a window mode) is produced by an **apply system** named
//!    `apply_*`, gated on `resource_changed::<ClientConfig>` /
//!    `resource_changed::<GameOptions>`, and living in the module that owns the
//!    thing it writes.
//! 3. A derived value is therefore **never** computed in `Plugin::build`.
//!    `Plugin::build` runs exactly once, so a value derived there can never
//!    follow a later edit — that is precisely the shape every "the setting does
//!    nothing until you restart" bug in this tree has had.
//!
//! `resource_changed` is true on the frame a resource is inserted, so the same
//! system seeds the derived value at boot and refreshes it afterwards. One code
//! path, no separate initialisation, nothing to keep in sync.
//!
//! # Adding a setting
//!
//! Put the field in its settings struct, read it in an `apply_*` system in the
//! module that owns the consumer, register that system with
//! `.run_if(resource_changed::<..>)`, and add the group to [`SETTINGS_AUDIT`].
//! [`the_audit_covers_every_client_config_group`] fails the build if a new
//! group appears in [`ClientConfig`] without an audit verdict, so a setting
//! cannot be added and quietly wired to nothing.
//!
//! # Where a setting genuinely cannot be live
//!
//! Some values decide *plugin registration* (`dev_tools`, `network_settings.
//! enabled`, `scenes`, `dev_fast_login`) — they are read in `main()` or in a
//! `Plugin::build` before the schedule exists, so "restart" is not a wiring
//! defect but the truth about them. Those carry [`Liveness::Restart`] with the
//! reason spelled out, and the UI must say so rather than pretend.
//!
//! # A group is not always one lifetime (#730)
//!
//! `ClientConfig` groups are `config.yaml` sections, not liveness units: a
//! section can hold one field that decides plugin registration and another
//! that is read from `Res<ClientConfig>` in a system every frame. Collapsing
//! those into a single verdict makes the row wrong in one direction whichever
//! verdict wins, so such a group carries [`Liveness::Mixed`] and its note
//! names the restart half *and* the live half by field.
