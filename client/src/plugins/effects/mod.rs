//! Runtime for JMXVEFF particle/visual effects: a CPU interpreter of the
//! effect node tree. Every live node is an ordinary Bevy entity, rendered
//! with the unlit [`material::SroEffectMaterial`].
//!
//! bevy_hanabi was evaluated and deliberately not used: SRO effects are many
//! tiny emitters (dozens of particles) with per-node materials, windowed
//! one-shot commands, and bone-anchored geometry — the inverse of hanabi's
//! few-effects/many-particles GPU-compute sweet spot. If dense ambient
//! effects (weather etc.) are ever needed, hanabi can be added alongside
//! this module without touching the JMXVEFF asset or spawn API.
