//! Mount/dismount transitions, rider transform slaving, mounted movement and
//! ground alignment.
//!
//! Idea: the server moves the COS entity, never the rider — so riding is (a)
//! routing the player's move orders to the COS (0x70C5 online, the COS's own
//! `RemoteMovement` offline) and (b) copying the COS transform onto every
//! rider each frame, after all movement systems ran. The copy is pure
//! render-space entity-to-entity, so no `WorldOrigin` math is involved.
//!
//! The rider sits on the mount's **`saddle` bone**: every rideable COS
//! skeleton in the 1.188 corpus carries one (`c_horse` bind position
//! `(0.00, 17.32, 0.27)`, parented to `Bip01 Spine`, so it bobs with the gait)
//! — see `docs/re/systems/mount.md`. We *sample* that bone rather than
//! parenting the rider under it: the body wrapper carries the SRO X-mirror
//! (`scale.x = -1`), which would mirror the rider, and a parented rider would
//! die with the mount.
//!
//! Mounts and pets also pitch/roll onto the ground. Nothing in the nav stack
//! exposes a surface normal, so [`align_cos_to_slope`] derives one by central
//! differences over `NavMeshRaycast::ground()` at the terrain grid step — the
//! same stencil the rendered terrain bakes its own normals from
//! (`assets/m/block_mesh.rs::region_normal`), so the model agrees with the
//! shading underneath it.
