//! COS (callable object summons: mounts, transports, pets, guild guards).
//!
//! Idea: a COS is an ordinary remote entity — it spawns through the shared
//! `RemoteEntity::Npc` pipeline (movement lerp, ground snap, nameplates,
//! selection all come for free) plus a [`CosEntity`] marker carrying what the
//! generic pipeline doesn't know: the COS subtype (characterdata tid4) and the
//! owner linkage. Riding is client-side slaving — the server moves the COS
//! entity and every rider copies its transform each frame — so mount state is
//! just [`RiderOf`] on the rider (see `docs/re/systems/mount.md`,
//! xBot `InfoManager.cs:743-771`). The wire family lives in
//! `packets/src/agent/pet.rs`; this plugin is its consumer: 0x30C8 seeds the
//! local player's summon list, 0x30C9 retires it, 0xB0CB flips mount state.
//! Everything works offline too (dev-spawned `local_only` COS skip the wire
//! and apply their transitions directly), which is how riding is testable
//! without a server.
