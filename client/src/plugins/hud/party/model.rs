//! Idea: the window itself is a fixed 8-row board — vanilla hard-declares one
//! pinned leader row plus seven `CIFPartySlot` instances and ships no scrollbar
//! and no paging control, so "which member is drawn in which row" is a total
//! function of the roster rather than a scroll state. That function lives here,
//! next to the two vitals readings, so both this window and the quick-party
//! board answer it identically and neither has to re-derive it from a comment.
