//! Reusable in-game window chrome: the vanilla mframe_wnd_* framed window.
//!
//! Idea: every draggable in-game window (inventory, and future ones like
//! storage, skills, party) shares the same shell — the 8-piece mframe_wnd_
//! frame ring with its built-in title band, a com_bg_tile_d interior, a
//! title text, a close (X) button and drag-to-move via the title strip.
//! `spawn_game_window` builds that shell for a given content size and hands
//! back the root (for the caller's marker/visibility management), the content
//! container (for the caller's actual UI) and the close button (for the
//! caller's close behavior via an `Activate` observer).
//!
//! Frame geometry (measured off the decoded textures): all pieces are fully
//! opaque; corners/sides are 40px wide, the top strip is 68px tall and
//! carries the integrated title band (dark bar between gold trim lines at
//! y 6..28, double-line separator at y 29..31), the bottom strip is 48px
//! tall. Past the frame's detailed edge the art is not flat black but a
//! dithered dark maroon/olive, so the content tucks into the ring and only
//! the `FRAME_VIS_*` margins remain visible, with the bg tiling overlaying
//! the ring's flat inner region out to those edges.
//!
//! Three things are caller-supplied through [`GameWindowStyle`] because the
//! data varies per window: the interior tile letter (11 distinct letters
//! corpus-wide), whether there is a caption at all (`GDR_MAINPOPUP` declares
//! an empty one) and whether there is a close button (the bag and equipment
//! trees declare none).
