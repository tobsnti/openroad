//! Party-matching board state: the page the server sent, the sort the player
//! chose, and which of the four dialogs is up.
//!
//! Idea: the board is a **pure view of one server page**. `0x706C` asks for a
//! page index and `0xB06C` answers with that page's entries plus how many pages
//! exist; there is no server-side search and no server-side sort in the wire
//! family at all. So paging is a request and sorting is local, and this module
//! keeps those two apart so neither can quietly become the other.
