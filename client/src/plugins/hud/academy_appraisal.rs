//! Guardian appraisal dialog — `ginterface.txt:1883` `GDR_APPRENTICESHIP_JUDGE`
//! id 155, tree `ifapprenticeshipjudge.txt` (6 blocks).
//!
//! Idea: this is the smallest of the Academy's four surfaces
//! (`docs/re/ui/hud-apprenticeship-window.md` §3.4, build-plan step 5) and it
//! needs no new machinery — it is the shared `msgbox2_window_` shell
//! (`hud/modal_dialog.rs`) with three stacked backgrounds, one
//! `CIFRadioButton` **group container** and the two 76x24 `com_button.ddj`
//! footer buttons. Everything here is one of the tree's six authored rects;
//! nothing is derived and nothing is invented.
//!
//! What the dialog is *for* is the graduating **apprentice's evaluation of
//! the guardian** (`UIIT_STT_TC_APPRAISAL_GUARDIAN` = "Guardian Evaluation",
//! which is also the window's own `Text=` in the layout file). The radio group
//! is where the verdict is picked.
//!
//! **The options are layout, not state.** The layout file carries **one**
//! `CIFRadioButton` group block and no per-option data, which makes it look as
//! if the verdicts could only come from a server. The shipped text says
//! otherwise: `Media/server_dep/silkroad/textdata/textuisystem.txt` contains
//! exactly **seven** `_TC_APPRAISAL_` keys, and two of them are already spent
//! as layout text — `_GUARDIAN` is the window title and
//! `UIIT_CTL_TC_APPRAISAL_BUTTON` = "Evaluate" is the confirm button. The
//! remaining five are the verdict scale (best to worst, in file order): Very
//! satisfied / Satisfied / Average / Disappointed / Very disappointed. So the
//! option list is client data, it is exhaustive, and the grouping is not a
//! guess. The dialog draws [`APPRAISAL_OPTIONS`] rather than an empty group,
//! and `AcademyAppraisalState` carries no `options` vector for a server to
//! fill.
//!
//! **Reachability — this module is a geometry and text placeholder with no
//! entry point, and that is stated rather than hidden.** Nothing opens it: no
//! code outside this file sets `AcademyAppraisalState::open`, because what
//! opens the window in the original is unknown; it belongs to the graduation
//! flow. Wiring a guessed opener (a hotkey, a menu row) would be inventing
//! behaviour, so it is deliberately absent. What is known is that the verdict
//! fits the one candidate carrier: `0x7475` writes exactly **one** byte, the
//! right shape for one of five — but which byte stands for which verdict is
//! unknown, so [`on_confirm`] sends nothing and logs the picked index
//! instead.
//!
//! Deviation (stated, per §3.5 of the work-loop runbook): the authored radio
//! rect is `34,59,406,40`, which overruns the 420-wide hull by 20 px
//! (`34 + 406 = 440`). We keep the authored origin and clamp the width to the
//! plate's own right inset — an off-canvas 20 px is hand-authoring overflow,
//! and reproducing it would push the last option under the plate border.
