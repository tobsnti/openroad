//! Idea: 0x303D (`CharacterStatsUpdate`) already carries the entire vanilla
//! C-window right column — attack/defense ranges, hit/parry, STR/INT — but
//! only max HP/MP were consumed (mini-info). [`PlayerStats`] mirrors the full
//! packet plus the stat-point wallet (seeded from the 0x3013 character data,
//! updated by 0x304E), so the window rides on plain resource change
//! detection. Spending a point sends the EXPERIMENTAL 0x7050/0x7051 requests
//! and applies nothing until the server acks (0xB050/0xB051) — the new
//! STR/INT and max HP/MP then arrive in the follow-up 0x303D refresh.
