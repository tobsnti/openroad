//! Which HUD window Escape closes, and which dialog Enter confirms.
//!
//! Idea: the client had **no notion of window focus at all**. Layering is ~30
//! hand-assigned `GlobalZIndex` literals that never change, and Escape ran a
//! chain in `plugins::system_window` that closed the Esc menu, dropped the
//! target, or opened the Esc menu — and never touched a HUD window, so an open
//! inventory could only be closed by its own (X) or its own hotkey.
//!
//! This adds the smallest thing that fixes that: a **recency stamp** per
//! window. A window is stamped when it opens and re-stamped whenever a click
//! lands anywhere inside it, so "the focused window" is simply the visible one
//! with the highest stamp. No z-order is touched — raising a window on focus
//! would fight the authored ladder, and nothing asked for it.
//!
//! # Escape closes a window by pressing its own (X)
//!
//! [`HudWindow`] stores the window's close **button**, not a closer of its own,
//! and Escape triggers `Activate` on it. Every window already wires that button
//! to whatever closing means for it — clearing a `*State.open` flag, despawning
//! a rebuild-on-change tree, ending a session — so Escape reuses that path
//! instead of duplicating it, and the two cannot drift apart. Opting a window
//! in is one line next to the close-button wiring it already has.
//!
//! # The Escape chain
//!
//! Escape is now a strict priority order, and [`EscConsumed`] is what carries
//! the decision between the stages:
//!
//! 1. **transients** — an armed item, a carried skill, an open drop or practice
//!    prompt. These cancel and consume.
//! 2. **the focused window** (here).
//! 3. **the target**, then the Esc menu (`system_window::toggle_system_window`).
//!
//! Before this, stage 1 did not consume: cancelling an armed item *also* opened
//! the Esc menu in the same press, because nothing told the menu the press had
//! already been used.
//!
//! # Enter confirms a dialog by pressing its own OK
//!
//! [`HudDialog`] is the same trick for the other key: it names the dialog's
//! confirm button, and Enter triggers `Activate` on it. Every one of the ~20
//! dialogs in this tree already wires that button to whatever confirming means
//! for it — sending the request, closing the prompt, answering the petition —
//! so Enter reuses those handlers untouched and cannot drift from what the
//! mouse does. Opting in is one line next to the button the dialog already
//! builds.
//!
//! Enter has its own chain, because it already had an owner: pressing it with
//! no dialog up opens the chat box (`chat::input::handle_chat_enter`). So
//! [`EnterConsumed`] mirrors [`EscConsumed`] and the dialog stage runs first —
//! without that, one press would confirm the dialog *and* drop the player into
//! the chat input, the exact double-consumption `EscConsumed` exists to stop.
//!
//! Dialogs share the window recency stamp rather than a z-order scan: a
//! confirm prompt is almost always the most recently opened thing on screen,
//! which is precisely what the stamp already measures.
