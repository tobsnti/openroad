//! Player mini-info panel (top-left): portrait, name, level, HP/MP bars and
//! hwan/berserk pips.
//!
//! Idea: the layout is hand-transcribed from the vanilla UI definitions
//! (like char-select's `info_box` transcribes pscharacterselect.txt):
//! ginterface.txt's GDR_PLAYER_MINI_INFO places the 212x70 window and names
//! its frame art (a window_all.ddj atlas region), and every control in
//! `Media.pk2/resinfo/ifplayerminiinfo.txt` carries a `Rect=RECT,"x,y,w,h"`
//! in window space, used verbatim below and uniformly scaled. Values live in
//! the [`PlayerVitals`]
//! resource, seeded from CHARACTER_DATA (0x3013) and kept live by
//! `EntityBarsUpdate` (0x3057), `CharacterPointsUpdate` (0x304E, berserk pips)
//! and `CharacterStatsUpdate` (0x303D — the only packet carrying max HP/MP).
//!
//! The portrait is the actual player head: an offscreen `Camera3d` parented to
//! the player entity renders its meshes (tagged onto the Portrait render
//! layer) into a small target texture that the UI samples — so equipment and
//! facing come for free.
