//! In-game HUD elements (SceneState::GameWorld), built like the intro_v2 UI:
//! layouts hand-transcribed from the vanilla resinfo definitions, rendered as
//! BSN scenes on the persistent 2d UI camera.
//!
//! # Registration
//!
//! This file is a *registry*, not a wiring sheet. Every window owns a `Plugin`
//! next to its own code and `HudPlugin` only names it, so adding a window
//! touches one line here and nothing else. The previous shape — one 500-line
//! `HudPlugin::build` where each window appended to five or six shared blocks
//! (`init_resource`, the `OnEnter`/`OnExit` tuples, an `Update` tuple, the
//! `PostUpdate` tuple) — made this file a serialization point: *every* HUD
//! branch collided with *every* other HUD branch, so N concurrent windows cost
//! O(N^2) rebases that carried no semantic content (#558).
//!
//! Two consequences worth knowing: Bevy's 20-system tuple limit is now per
//! window rather than per HUD, so the "nested: the flat tuple exceeds Bevy's
//! 20-system limit" workarounds are gone; and system order inside a schedule
//! was already unordered, so splitting the shared tuples changed no behaviour
//! (the `.chain()` groups that *did* express order are intra-window and moved
//! together).

        // plate and the plate's insets, spawned by its callers' scenes.

        // pooled overlays (#661) — likewise pure functions, no systems and no
        // state; giving it a plugin would hand a helper a schedule it does not
        // need.

        // one BSN scene, driven by each window's own fill system.

        // resource are registered — by `QuestRewardPlugin`, next to the

        // struct and two pure functions, no systems and no state. It is shared
        // because the low-vitals overlays are authored TWICE at different sheet
        // sizes (the mini-info's 512x64 pair and the quick-party board's
