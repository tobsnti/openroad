//! State the stall window renders from (#779).

//! There is no wire in this ticket: the window is driven entirely from this
//! resource, the way `stall_network.rs` handles its own not-yet-known
//! opcodes. The stall wire is modelled in `packets/src/agent/stall.rs` and its
//! remainder is #759 — a layout invented here to "fill in" would be exactly
//! what that ticket exists to prevent.
