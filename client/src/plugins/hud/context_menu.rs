//! The `ub_new_wnd_` popup menu — one widget, several call sites.
//!
//! Idea: the target right-click menu (`res_ui/targetmenu.2dt`) and the
//! under-bar's Menu flyout (`res_ui/nifundermenubar.2dt`) are the *same*
//! construction at two sizes — a `CNIFrame` on `interface\frame\ub_new_wnd_`, a
//! `CNIFNormaltile` of `com_bg_tile_u.ddj` at inset 20, and rows of
//! `ub_new_menu_button.ddj`. The recovered client module map homes the
//! construction to `NIFUnderMenuBar.cpp` and contains no `NIFTargetMenu.cpp`,
//! so the target menu is an instance of that popup, not a class of its own
//! (`docs/re/ui/hud-target-menu.md` §3.3, `[S]`).
//!
//! The geometry law that makes one widget serve both: **every one of the eight
//! `ub_new_wnd_` pieces is exactly 20x20 and there is no centre piece**, so the
//! client area is the frame rect deflated by 20 on all four sides. That
//! reproduces both authored fills byte-for-byte — `638,321,102,142` →
//! `658,341,62,102` (target menu) and `758,44,138,403` → `778,64,98,363`
//! (under-bar) — which is why the panel here is *sized from its content*
//! instead of carrying a hardcoded 142.
//!
//! Deviation, stated: the original's row pitch alternates 20/19/20/19 (mean
//! 19.5, not expressible as an integer step) and its rows overhang the fill by
//! 12px on each side. This widget uses a uniform 20px pitch and keeps the rows
//! inside the client area. The overhang appears in *both* authored instances, so
//! it is the family's idiom rather than a defect — revisit it on a screenshot
//! (`docs/re/ui/hud-target-menu.md` §9-U2).
