//! The COS command bar — the fold-out strip of summon commands.
//!
//! Idea: vanilla assembles this bar in code, and we can prove it rather than
//! assume it. `resinfo/ifcoscommand.txt` declares only two blocks (the tab
//! plate and its toggle button) and no resinfo file anywhere instantiates a
//! `CIFCOSCommand` window — but Media ships an unreferenced
//! `am_ctrl_window_front|middle|end` set (44/32/36 × 36), i.e. a front + repeat
//! + cap strip whose width is chosen at runtime from the number of commands.
//! That is exactly the thing the resinfo grammar cannot express as a `Rect`,
//! which is why the authored file is a stub. See
//! `docs/re/ui/cos-pet-window.md` §9.
//!
//! So the *chrome* here is all vanilla — the stretch plate, the authored tab
//! (`0,11,36,28`) and toggle (`5,16,16,16`) rects, the `cos_cmd_*` icons, the
//! `am_key_0N` hotkey glyphs and the `UIIT_STT_COS_*` captions.
//!
//! **The cells are chosen per COS kind.** That is what makes the six shipped
//! key glyphs a non-constraint: a transport is never aimed at anything and a
//! pet is never boarded, so no single kind needs more than six cells even
//! though the vanilla command inventory is far larger. Which commands each
//! kind shows, and in what order, is **ours** — see `slots_for`.
//!
//! The bar sits directly above the skillbar (screenshot-evidenced 2026-08-19;
//! it used to hang beside the minimap, which was a convenience) and acts on
//! one summon at a time — [`CosBarSubject`], switched by clicking a slot in
//! the status stack.
