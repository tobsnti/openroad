//! Quickslot activation → a fire-and-forget request for the owning plugin.
//!
//! Idea: the underbar's UI handlers never talk to the network themselves —
//! they translate a slot activation into an intent message. A skill slot emits
//! a `CastRequest` (target = the currently selected entity), turned into the
//! 0x7074 packet (or the local simulation offline) by
//! `skills::cast::dispatch_casts`. An item slot emits a [`UseItemRequest`];
//! [`dispatch_item_use`] resolves it against the live inventory + itemdata and
//! sends the 0x704C ItemUseRequest. Fire-and-forget either way: the server's
//! ack (0xB074.. for skills, 0xB04C for items) is logged/handled elsewhere,
//! never used to gate UI state.
