//! Inventory window layout and refresh.
//!
//! Idea: like the other HUDs, every rect below is hand-transcribed from the
//! vanilla resinfo definitions (`ifinventory.txt` for the left item-grid
//! panel, `ifequipment.txt` for the right equipment panel) and uniformly
//! scaled, all placed inside the shared framed window shell built by
//! `hud::game_window` (mframe chrome, tiled interior, title band with close
//! button, drag-to-move). The item grid reproduces the vanilla `CIFLattice`: the four
//! 36x36 `com_lattice_*` textures are edge variants — `left_up` is the
//! interior tile carrying the separator + junction star on its right/bottom
//! edges, the `right_*`/`*_down` variants terminate the last column/row. The
//! window is spawned once on entering a playable scene (hidden) and toggled
//! via `InventoryState.open`; `refresh_inventory` repaints icons, stack
//! counts, tabs, gold and equipment from the player's `Inventory` component.
//! Slot cells carry hover observers (tooltip) and Press/Release observers
//! implementing the vanilla carry interaction: press an item to pick it up
//! (a ghost icon sticks to the cursor), then either release over the target
//! (classic drag) or click it up and click the target (vanilla click-carry) —
//! both send the same move request, applied only when the server confirms
//! (model.rs). Dropping equipment anywhere on the equipment panel equips it
//! into its type-derived slot, like the original client. Built on raw
//! Press/Release instead of bevy_picking's DragDrop because DragDrop only
//! reaches entities hovered mid-drag and never the press target, which made
//! short drags silently do nothing.

// --- Animated icon effects --------------------------------------------------
//
// The original animates the *item icon itself* for special items, with a
// sprite sheet per category under `icon/item/etc/`. Each one tiles exactly into
// 32x32 tiles — the icon's own size — with no remainder, which is what
// identifies them as frame sheets rather than plain art:
//
//   icon_edge_rare.ddj      256x128  8x4  = 32 frames
//   icon_edge_nasrun.ddj    512x32   16x1 = 16 frames
//   icon_edge_legendry.ddj  640x64   20x2 = 40 frames
//
// (Measured from the DDS headers. A census of that folder finds nine
// multi-frame 32px sheets in all; the other six are event items.)
//
// This is what the pulsing gold rectangle we used to draw was standing in for.
//
// Two things the archive does NOT give, because no resinfo control references
// these sheets at all — the whole `Style=512` corpus is six controls on four
// files, all vitals gauges. So the *cadence* and the *frame order* are
// code-side in the original and are ours to choose:
//   * frame_ms is a config knob (`hud.icon_effect_frame_ms`), not a constant.
//   * row-major is assumed, matching `hud::cooldown`'s own sheet walk.
