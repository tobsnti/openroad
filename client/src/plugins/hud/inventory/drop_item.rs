//! Dragging an item out of the bag and onto the ground.
//!
//! Idea: the inventory carries an item with press/release rather than
//! `bevy_picking`'s `DragDrop` (see `ui.rs`'s header), and every existing
//! catcher for that carry is a UI node — a slot cell, the equipment panel, the
//! bag panel. A release that hits none of them simply left the carry live, so
//! "drag it out of the window" had no meaning at all.
//!
//! So the missing catcher is "nobody at all", and that is what
//! [`detect_drop_on_nothing`] adds: the same mouse edge every other catcher
//! polls, plus the observation that a carry is still live and the pointer is
//! outside every window that would take one.
//!
//! An earlier cut asked the *terrain* instead — `nav::decal`'s cursor ray had
//! already resolved a walkable hit, so it emitted the drop from there. That was
//! too narrow: releasing over a wall, over the sky, or over a HUD panel that
//! accepts nothing produced no drop and no feedback, because none of those is
//! walkable ground. `nav::decal` still suppresses the *move order* while a
//! carry is live — a click that drops an item must not also walk the character
//! — but it no longer decides what a drop is.
//!
//! **The confirmation is not optional.** Dropping is irreversible and public —
//! `UIIT_MSG_DROP_WARNING_1` is the original's own wording for why ("If you
//! drop this item anyone will be able to grab it.") — so the release raises a
//! modal and only its Confirm reaches the wire.
//!
//! ⚠️ **The opcode is unverified.** See [`InventoryOperationRequest::Drop`]:
//! op 7 is named by exactly one secondary source and has never been seen on
//! the wire. The send is logged at `info!` on purpose, so the first live drop
//! shows whether it is right.
