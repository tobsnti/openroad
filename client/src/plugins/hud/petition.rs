//! The shared invite/petition popup (0x3080) — the invitee's side.
//!
//! Idea: the original raises **one** confirm box for party, exchange, guild,
//! academy and resurrection invites, keyed by a leading `type` byte, and the
//! answer travels back on the same opcode carrying *neither* an id nor a type
//! — the server correlates it by session. That protocol shape makes a **single**
//! pending slot an invariant rather than a simplification: two boxes on screen
//! could not be answered independently, because the wire has no way to say
//! which one. Hence one [`PendingPetition`] resource, and never two dialogs.
//!
//! What ships here are the **party arms** (`type` 2 `PartyCreation` and 3
//! `PartyInvitation`) and the **exchange arm** (`type` 1), whose continuation
//! exists: accepting it makes the server send 0x3085 and `hud::exchange`
//! takes over from there. Its accept/decline encoding is the family
//! default `01 01` / `01 00`, and its body is one sourced line rather than the
//! party arm's three. The remaining arms are decoded, logged and named to the
//! player as a system line, but do not open a box: resurrection belongs to the
//! death flow, and guild/union/academy have unknown response encodings —
//! sending an unverified decline would be the guess this file is built to
//! avoid.
//!
//! **Chrome and geometry** come from the game's own data, not from this file's
//! judgement: `resinfo/ifmessagebox.txt` `Section = MsgBoxSimple` authors Yes
//! at `72,99,76,24` and No at `152,99,76,24` (both `com_button.ddj`, native
//! 76x24) with the message textbox at `0,52,240,14`, over the family's
//! `Section = Create` interior `16,40,284,122`. That interior is what fixes
//! the plate size: [`crate::plugins::hud::modal_dialog::modal_interior`]
//! inverts to exactly **316x178**, which is a second, independent confirmation
//! of the shared `msgbox2_window_` insets (16/40/16) — see the test.
//!
//! **One stated deviation.** The authored message box is `0,52,240,14`, i.e.
//! x = 0 with width 240 inside a 316-wide plate; its `HAlign=1` centres the
//! text, which would land it 38px left of the plate's centre. The authored x is
//! a host-relative artifact (a `CIFTextBox` whose content the original feeds in
//! code), so the **width 240 is kept and centred**, and the box grows downward
//! for the extra lines the party arm needs. The y, the height per line and both
//! button rects are verbatim.
