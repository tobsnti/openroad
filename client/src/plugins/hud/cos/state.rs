//! COS (companion) runtime state: what the summon packets say about the COS the
//! player currently has out.
//!
//! Idea: `0x30C8 PetData` / `0x30C9 PetUpdate` were already decoded by the
//! `packets` crate and then **thrown away** — nothing in `client/` read either
//! (`docs/re/ui/cos-pet-window.md` §7, #656). This resource is the consumer: it
//! keeps the wire's own types rather than a flattened copy, so the info page
//! renders what the server actually said and nothing more.
//!
//! The one thing the wire does **not** carry is *which kind* of COS this is.
//! `0x30C8`'s body is kind-dependent, and the original resolves the kind from
//! refdata, not from the packet (#545) — so the kind comes from characterdata's
//! `TypeID4` via [`ChardataRow::cos_kind`](crate::assets::textdata::characterdata),
//! which is the single implementation of that gate.
//!
//! **More than one COS can be out at once.** A player may ride a horse while a
//! growth pet fights and a pick pet loots, so this resource holds a list keyed
//! by unique id rather than the single slot it started as; every consumer that
//! wants "the pet" asks for a kind.
//!
//! The refdata lookup, the kind resolution and the body decode are one shared
//! function with one drop path ([`crate::plugins::cos::resolve_pet_data`]), so
//! this window and the status stack can never disagree about what a summon is.
