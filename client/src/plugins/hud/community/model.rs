//! Community window state: open/closed plus which of the six pages shows.
//!
//! Idea: `GDR_COMMUNITY:CIFCommunity` (`resinfo/ginterface.txt:541`, id 23,
//! `Rect="0,0,477,393"`) is the shell six page controls hang off, each declared
//! in `resinfo/ifcommunity.txt` on the one shared rect `13,61,451,320`. The
//! resinfo grammar has no `Visible` key, so one-page-at-a-time is the inferred
//! reading of that shared rect (the same idiom as the COS pages and the option
//! panes). Page ids are the data's own: Guild 10, GuildRelations 11, WarState
//! 12, Friend 13, Letter 14, Blocking 15.
//!
//! `ifcommunity.txt` guards its first page with `#ifdef
//! CHATTING_BLOCKING_SYSTEM` / `#else #ifdef WHISPER_BLOCKING_SYSTEM`; both
//! symbols are defined in `config/define.txt`, so the **first** branch wins and
//! `GDR_COMMUNITY_BLOCKING:CIFBlocking` (id 15) is the live page, while
//! `CIFWhisperBlocking` is dead.
