//! Auto-attack combat: click-again-to-attack → 0x7074 → server-driven swings.
//!
//! Idea: vSRO combat is server-driven. One 0x7074 Attack request makes the
//! server path the character into range (through the normal 0xB021 movement
//! reconciliation) and repeat basic-attack swings until a Cancel or the target
//! dies — the client never schedules swings itself. Its job is presentation:
//! each 0xB070 [`ObjectActionUpdate`] names the acting entity (one-shot attack
//! animation via [`AttackSwing`]) and the damaged targets (floating hitcount
//! numbers via [`DamagePopup`] plus an optimistic HP decrement); 0x3057
//! remains the authoritative HP source and later overwrites the same values.
