//! Animation-linked sound effects from the `.bsr` mod palette (Sound
//! ModData, `0x0005 0000`).
//!
//! Idea: the original binds SFX to *animation keytimes*, not to gameplay
//! events — a mob's death thud is "347 ms into the die clip of the default
//! group", a footstep is "N ms into the run clip" (`docs/re/formats/
//! moddata-unhandled.md` §3: 615 files, 45,086 tracks). The .bsr loader
//! keeps those tracks per (group, animation type) in
//! [`AnimationSounds`](crate::commands::AnimationSounds); this module is the
//! player.
//!
//! Rather than scheduling timers when an animation starts (what the particle
//! side does, [`sync_animation_effects`](crate::plugins::effects::spawn)),
//! this samples the [`AnimationPlayer`]'s own seek time each frame and fires
//! a track when the clip's playhead crosses its keytime. That is what makes
//! a **looping** clip work: run/walk animations repeat, so their footsteps
//! have to fire once per lap, and a one-shot timer at clip start would play
//! them exactly once.
//!
//! Playback is **positional** (#774): the sound entity is a child of the
//! emitter, so it inherits its `GlobalTransform`, and it plays through
//! rodio's spatial mixer against the [`SpatialListener`] on the game camera.
//! The distance curve comes from the mod palette's own DS3D parameters —
//! `[3] = 10.0` / `[4] = 100.0`, constant across the corpus
//! (`docs/re/formats/moddata-unhandled.md` §3) — mapped onto the mixer by
//! [`SPATIAL_SCALE`]. An emitter without a `GlobalTransform` falls back to the
//! old non-positional spawn rather than warning once per sound.
//!
//! Two deviations (ADR-0009), both deliberate:
//!
//! * **Every animation sound is 3D, not just the flagged ones.** The original
//!   marks only 533 of its 22,051 sound buffers `0x90` (CTRL3D|CTRLVOLUME);
//!   the rest are `0xC0` (CTRLPAN|CTRLVOLUME, 2D). Those flags live in the
//!   Sound entry's 11-dword config header, which our track scanner
//!   (`assets::bsr::bsr::parse_sound_mods`) deliberately does not walk — it
//!   anchors on the innermost track. Playing a mob's footstep from the mob is
//!   what a player expects; honouring the per-entry flag needs the scanner to
//!   retain the header first and is a follow-up, not a reason to stay flat.
//! * **The rolloff is inverse-square, not DirectSound's inverse.** rodio 0.22
//!   attenuates each ear by `min(1/d², 1)` in scaled units and that is not
//!   configurable (`rodio::source::Spatial::set_positions`). With
//!   [`SPATIAL_SCALE`] the sound is at full level inside the palette's 10-unit
//!   min distance — exactly the DS3D min-distance semantics — and is 40 dB
//!   down at its 100-unit max distance where DirectSound would be 20 dB down.
//!   Quieter far away, same near field.
