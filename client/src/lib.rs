// Parser-only library surface of the client crate.
//
// The client binary keeps its full module tree in main.rs; this lib target
// exposes only the pure SRO format parsers (bsr/bms/bmt/bsk/ban/ddj and
// their helpers) so external tools (tools/src/bin/bsr2glb) can reuse them
// without duplicating byte-level format knowledge. The subset is closed:
// these modules reference only each other, never plugins/scenes/commands.
//
// Trade-off: the listed files compile twice (once per target) and their
// #[cfg(test)] suites run for both, which is benign. Extend the list if a
// new transitive module reference appears.
