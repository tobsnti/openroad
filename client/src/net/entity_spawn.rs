//! Decodes the vSRO 1.88 group-spawn payload (0x3019) into entities to spawn or
//! despawn.
//!
//! Idea: the payload is a `count`-long list (count from the preceding
//! `GroupEntitySpawnBegin`) of variable-length, type-dependent records — a
//! player record embeds an equipment ref-id list whose per-item width depends on
//! whether each item is equipment, which needs itemdata. That is the same reason
//! `CharacterDataBody` is a raw passthrough, so the whole payload is carried
//! unparsed and decoded here, where the client's characterdata/itemdata tables
//! live. Each record starts with a `ref_id` (u32); its type (player / NPC /
//! monster / dropped item) is resolved from that id against those tables, which
//! selects the per-record layout. Because records are variable-length and
//! back-to-back, a mis-parse can't recover the next record boundary, so on any
//! unknown type or short read we stop the batch and return what parsed so far
//! (fail-safe, mirroring `character_data.rs`) rather than desync.
//!
//! Layout is calibrated against a live vSRO 1.88 capture: the player and
//! NPC records (incl. the `tag + u8 count + option bytes` interaction list) are
//! verified; the monster rarity tail and the dropped-item branch are still
//! cross-referenced with skrillax and pending a capture.
//!
//! COS (pet/mount) records and the mounted-player conditional are [S]
//! spec-derived from xBot `PacketParser.cs:735-807` (no capture yet — promoted
//! to [V] by CAPTURE_LIST F3/F7/F8): a COS record is the NPC record plus a
//! tid4-dependent owner tail, and a riding player inserts a `u32` mount uid
//! between its state flags — both used to desync the whole batch.
